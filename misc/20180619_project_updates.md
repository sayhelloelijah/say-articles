# Website Update #1
As mentioned before in the previous post, I will be making some changes to this site. I decided to tackle this project with incremental changes.
The first of these changes will be removing the "Projects" sections from the homepage and navigation. Let me explain my reasoning.

## Reason #1 - Focus
When the site was originally in it's planning stages, I was seeking out freelance opportunities within my web development skills.
So, as any logical person who has the skill of building sites, I built my own site that would be focused on getting clients.
That type of site would need to have sample work and would be easily visible to the public for any inquiries.

<blockquote>Nothing is as permanent as change.<br/>-Dr. Myles Munroe</blockquote>

Well, that didn't go quite like I expected it. As Dr. Myles Munroe once stated, _Nothing is as permanent as change_.
Within the past two years, I haven't really gotten any clients, plenty of leads, but no true clients. Also, my want
to do freelance work had started to diminish. I started to want more. Not only to develop sites, but rather to develop
businesses, including my own. I'm a speaker, a minister, and I have a strong knack for transforming things into success.

All in all, my focus changed so my platform. My little bit of real estate on the web now will change, some what.
 
## Reason #2 - Lack of Projects
So, as mentioned in the previous statement. Though I was getting some leads, I wasn't landing any projects. Most of
these occurrences were because of lack of budget, funds, or commitment. I even had one that started out great, but the
work was becoming a strain as I had severely undercharged for the project (completely my fault).

So because the number of projects that are currently available for are so limited, I feel it is best not to display
them on the homepage. Though they will still be within the site at the same URL. Because the time may come that I want
to show someone what I can do. I do still want to maintain a record of work.

## Conclusion (tl;dr)
To wrap it up, I'm removing the projects section from the main navigation and homepage. The reason is because
the direction I want to take my life and interests should be reflected in the site that represents me on the INternet.

Thank you!
